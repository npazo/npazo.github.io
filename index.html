            <h1>I'm Nick Pazoles.</h1>
            
            <h2>I'm a dad.</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dad of two boys under 5. My parenting experience vacillates between indescribable happiness 
                and constant anxiety (IYKYK). Along with my wife, we live in Palatine, IL, a northwest suburb of Chicago.
            </p>
            
            <h2>I'm a DevOps Engineer.</h2>
            <p>
                I have been doing what is now called "DevOps" for almost my entire 15+ year career. I have been a 
                "buildmaster", configuration management engineer, site reliability engineer and just plain ol' 
                DevOps engineer at companies from 10 people to 10,000. Currently I am blending my skills with my 
                biggest hobby (sports) as Lead DevOps Engineer at 
                <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com">Sports Reference LLC.</a> My role is part DevOps, part 
                Site Reliability Engineer, part IT "guy".
            </p>
            
            <h2>I am a Apple Geek.</h2>
            <p>
                "Fanboy" has become too much of a pejorative, but for years I would have described myself as an 
                Apple fanboy. I have been almost exclusively on macOS (when I have a choice) for nearly 20 years. 
                I have had an iPhone since the 3G. I love how macOS blends *nix into a beautiful, intuitive package.

            <h2>I'm a big sports fan.</h2>
            <p>
                I don't just mean my <em>physical</em> size, I love sports. Particularly baseball and (college) 
                football. And within that the Chicago White Sox, Michigan Wolverines (not an alumnus) and the 
                Chicago Bears. The White Sox World Series run in 2005 is my all-time favorite sports moment that 
                seems impossibly almost 20 years ago.
